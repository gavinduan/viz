<para>
The Viz Roll is used to build scientific visualization clusters with Rocks.  
Traditional Rocks-based compute clusters consist of a single Frontend 
machine and several back end Compute machines.  However, a Rocks-based 
visualization cluster is composed of Tile machines instead of Compute 
machines.  A Tile machine must have an nVidia graphics card and may drive 
one or two LCD monitors (or projectors).

<para>
The only included visualization middleware is 
<ulink url="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/">Chromium</ulink>.
CGLX can be installed from its Roll, and SAGE can be installed
manually.
