<para>
The Viz Roll is used to build scientific visualization clusters with Rocks.  
Traditional Rocks-based compute clusters consist of a single Frontend 
machine and several back end Compute machines.  However, a Rocks-based 
visualization cluster is composed of Tile machines instead of Compute 
machines.  A Tile machine must have an nVidia graphics card and may drive 
one or two LCD monitors (or projectors).  The major visualization-middleware 
components are <ulink url="http://dmx.sourceforge.net/">DMX</ulink>,
<ulink url="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/">Chromium</ulink> and 
<ulink url="http://www.evl.uic.edu/cavern/sage/">SAGE</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
DMX is part of the XFree86 project and has origins in the Xinerama
code used to create a single X11 root window that spans across two 
physical monitors.  DMX extends this to create a single root window (desktop)
that spans across a rectangular wall of monitors or projectors.  Although
DMX can display OpenGL applications, it is recommended that Chromium 
be used with DMX for all OpenGL code.  This Roll supports the
use of DMX with and without Chromium support.  It also supports Chromium in
stand-alone mode for use without DMX.
</para>

<para>
SAGE (Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment) is developed by the Cavern
Group at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the Univeristy
of Illinois Chicago (UIC).  SAGE can display both OpenGL and raw pixel
blasting applications at full speed on large-scale tile displays.  
Applications must be written specifically for the SAGE environment, unlike
DMX and Chromium.  However, applications such as the SAGE version of
mplayer can play HD qualities movies over a 60 tile wall at full speed,
which is not possible using DMX (or Chromium).
