Revision 1.9  2011/01/28 02:17:28  mjk
Docbook cleanup (using Viz Roll as proto-type)
- consistent entity naming (no more mixing of '-' and '_')
- roll compat page only lists specified rolls (version.mk)
- added note about using all OS cds with non-core rolls (e.g. viz)
- added entities for roll names, and bools
- logical styles used instead of direct formatting
  e.g. constant vs. emphasis
Works for Viz (needs new devel env installed)
TODO: Update Base Roll to further standardize (slow)
TODO: Cleanup all other Rolls (fast)

Revision 1.8  2011/01/03 20:27:14  mjk
- Working (and documented) Google Earth procedure
- Simplified docs / commands for TwinView and Bezel hiding

<para>
The most basic &rocks; clusters consist of a single <constant>frontend</constant> 
machine and several back end <constant>compute</constant>
or <constant>vm-container</constant> machines.
The &roll-viz; roll adds a new <constant>tile</constant>
appliance used to build &TDW;s.  
Each <constant>tile</constant> of a wall can control one, two, or four
displays using a single nVidia card.
There is no support for other video cards, or support for multiple
nVidia cards per machine.
</para>

<para>
In addition to tools for configurating and managing &TDW;s, this &roll; includes 
<ulink url="http://chromium.sourceforge.net/">Chromium</ulink>
for running OpenGL applications.
Other middleware such as
<ulink url="http://vis.ucsd.edu/~cglx/">CGLX</ulink>
can be installed from its own roll, and 
<ulink url="http://www.sagecommons.org">SAGE</ulink>
can be installed manually.
</para>

<para>
The &roll-viz; roll also provides the CUDA drivers and SDK
which can optionally be included on any appliance type,
including <constant>compute</constant>s.
