<title>ConfigSetting LCD Bezels Height and Width</title>

<para>
The Viz Roll supports control over hiding of pixels behind LCD mullions 
(bezels) for both Chromium, and SAGE.

The default is to not hide the bezels.
In this mode all images rendered on the wall will display all pixels.
This effect can be distracting for movies and other moving images.  
The <computeroutput>rocks enable hidebezels</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>rocks disable hidebezels</computeroutput> commands can be 
used to control this behavior.

<para>
Chromium is used to display OpenGL applications on the wall.  
It can be used both with and without DMX (next section).  
Chromium support is controlled by the 
<computeroutput>rocks enable chromium</computeroutput> and 
<computeroutput>rocks disable chromium</computeroutput> commands.  
Once enabled all dynamically linked OpenGL application will use the 
Chromium GL libraries.  
Some newer applications may contain code written to a later OpenGL 
specification than is supported by Chromium, however, most application work
without any source code changes.

<title>SAGE</title>

<para>
SAGE can be started and stopped using the 
<computeroutput>rocks start sage</computeroutput> and 
<computeroutput>rocks stop sage</computeroutput> commands.  
The Rocks integration of SAGE differs from the standard EVL practices of
deploying SAGE in two ways.  
First, starting SAGE will create a per-user copy of /opt/sage in ~/.sage and 
all configuration files will be  generated into this user directory.  
Second, the <computeroutput>rocks stop sage</computeroutput> command is used 
by the GUI to kill all SAGE processes, this new kill behavior can 
take several seconds to track done orphaned SAGE processes.
